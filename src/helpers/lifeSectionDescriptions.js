    + "Effect team. It was a fascinating time of bringing together an idea "
    + "into a fully immersive experience. As a team of three people, our "
    + "responsibilities frequently blurred, but my primary focus "
    + "consisted of constructing the scenic elements and project planning. "
    + "These images are some of the rooms installed in a new facility in "

  hobbies: "When not reading or playing video games, these are a "
    + "glimpse into the projects which help keep my brain occupied. "
    + "I have been an active participant in collaborative story telling for "
    + "about five years now. Many know this hobby better as Dungeons and Dragons, "
    + "but D&D is only a household name for the variety which exists. I have "
    + "started a small collection of different systems, with Pathfinder the most "
    + "consistently played. I am quite dedicated to working with others, including "
    + "an assortment of collaborative board games. Well not all of them are, but "
    + "about three quarters focus on working together. I regularly feel the need "
    + "to make things, and sometimes I need it to be physical. This usually means it's"
    + "time to make bread. I have made bread from scratch regularly for about three "
    + "years. This ranges from challah to wurzelbrot, with plenty to share.",
  dragons: "I have always loved the varying worlds of fantasy. The way people can "
    + "paint beautiful images with words. Perhaps that led to some of my love of "
    + "dragons. Whether the dragons of J.K. Rowling or Anne McCaffrey, they are "
    + "incredible creatures. Over the years, I have amassed a collection of wyrms, "
    + "drakes, wyverns, and dragons. Here's a small sample, just for fun."
